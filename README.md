# Social Media Management Tools

#### My motive while completing this project was to follow the patterns of separation of concerns and have separated code blocks depending on functionality as much as possible and try to keep the code short, simple and understandable while maintaining the same functionality without error-prone code. ðŸš€
#
#### The project was created mainly using React, Redux, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. ðŸ› 
* Additionally <b>UUID</b> was used and for the icons, I used libraries such as <b>Font Awesome, Bootstrap Icon</b> etc.
* For the brands in the sidebar, the <b>exact same</b> brand logos, found and taken from [Freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com), were used.
* <b>SVG</b> circles were created for dynamically colored bullet points for the color status bar.
#
#### <ins>The app is thoroughly dynamic and functional. Whenever a new post is added or a new brand is selected from the sidebar, all the corresponding data and the styling will be updated without any further action required.</ins>

* Random dummy notifications for the brands have been added in order to show the dynamic sidebar & accordion menu functionality. Posts are updated according to their date of publishment. The social media icons of the published posts are directly linked to the published website. When a different brand is selected from the brands bar, notifications dynamically change.
