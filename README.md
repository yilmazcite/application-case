# Social Media Management Tools

#### My motive while completing this project was to follow the patterns of <b>separation of concerns</b> and have separated code blocks depending on functionality as much as possible and trying to keep the code short, simple and understandable while <b>maintaining the same functionality without error-prone code. ðŸš€</b>
#
#### The project was created mainly using <b>React, Redux, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS</b>.
* Additionally <b>UUID</b> was used and for the icons, I used libraries such as <b>Font Awesome, Bootstrap Icon</b> etc.
* For the brands in the sidebar, the <b>exact same</b> brand logos, found and taken from [Freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com), were used.
* <b>SVG</b> circles were created for dynamically colored bullet points for the color status bar.
#
#### <ins>The app is thoroughly dynamic and functional. Whenever a new post is added or a new brand is selected from the sidebar, all the corresponding data and the styling will be updated without any further action required.</ins>

* Random dummy notifications for the brands have been added in order to show the dynamic sidebar & accordion menu functionality. Posts are updated according to their date of publishment. The social media icons of the published posts are directly linked to the published website. When a different brand is selected from the brands bar, notifications dynamically change.
